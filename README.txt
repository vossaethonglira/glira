GLIRA Static Site (v2)

You asked for 3840×2400 full-screen hero animation.
This package includes a lightweight placeholder: assets/media/hero_placeholder.gif.
Replace it with your 3840×2400 MP4 (recommended) or GIF and update index.html hero tag accordingly.

- Eye icon: hover/click opens "At a glance" overlay with 4 entry points.
- Nav: starts at bottom. On scroll, docks to top.
- Right rail: 9 icon buttons only (no text). Replace assets/icons/p1..p9.svg.
- Subpages: hero is 2/3 viewport static image.

Docs:
